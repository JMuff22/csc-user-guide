# Merlin/Flux


## Strengths:

* Flux runs as single job step so does not cause increased number of jobs or job steps
* No persistent database setup needed
* MPI is supported with Flux (with correct versions of MPI)
* Useful for more complicated workflows with several steps

## Weeknesses:

* Folder hierarchy for tasks, creates four files per workflow item
* Requires at least Redis DB for results, optionally RabbitMQ for message brokering


## Supported with caveats
