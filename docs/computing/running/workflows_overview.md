rkflow management systems are handy in managing and executing  multistep complex computational tasks in scientific data analysis. while the workflows generally aims facilitate such as reproducibility, usability and portability, use of a specific workflow inn HPC environment has to used cautiously.  The following table tries to give you a better pictures of
differennt workflows in CSC supercomputing environment.
